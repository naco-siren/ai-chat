# Privacy Policy of Arm AI Chat 

This app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data. 
All core functionality, including LLM inference and chat history, runs entirely on the user's device. No user inputs or results are sent to external servers. 

However, the app optionally provides a model download feature from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), which allows users to retrieve preselected GGUF models. These downloads occur over the public internet and may be visible to the Hugging Face service infrastructure. Please refer to Hugging Face's own [privacy policy](https://huggingface.co/privacy) for further details. 
Users are not required to use the model download feature. If preferred, users may operate the app in a fully offline mode by manually obtaining GGUF model files and importing them from the device’s local storage.
